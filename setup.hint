sdesc: "GNOME predictive text entry system"
ldesc: "Dasher is a zooming predictive text entry system, designed for 
situations where keyboard input is impractical (for instance, 
accessibility or PDAs). It is usable with highly limited amounts of 
physical input while still allowing high rates of text entry."
